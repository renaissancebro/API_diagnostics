# Requirements Document

## Introduction

API Diagnostics is a debugging tool designed to help backend developers quickly identify and trace 400/500 errors from frontend API calls back to specific code locations and backend issues. The tool focuses on correlation tracking, enhanced error formatting, and request logging to streamline the debugging process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer debugging frontend API issues, I want unique correlation IDs for each API request, so that I can easily trace errors across frontend and backend logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [an API request is made] THEN [the system] SHALL generate a unique correlation ID
2. WHEN [a correlation ID is generated] THEN [the system] SHALL include it in both frontend console logs and backend request logs
3. WHEN [an error occurs] THEN [the system] SHALL display the correlation ID prominently in error messages
4. WHEN [I search logs by correlation ID] THEN [the system] SHALL return all related frontend and backend log entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer encountering API errors, I want enhanced error response formatting, so that I can quickly understand what went wrong and where.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [a 400 error occurs] THEN [the system] SHALL return structured error details including field validation errors and error codes
2. WHEN [a 500 error occurs] THEN [the system] SHALL return the failing backend service/function name and error category
3. WHEN [any API error occurs] THEN [the system] SHALL include stack trace information in development mode
4. WHEN [error responses are logged] THEN [the system] SHALL format them consistently across all endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer debugging API issues, I want comprehensive request/response logging with filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find and analyze problematic API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [any API request is made] THEN [the system] SHALL log the request method, URL, headers, body, and timestamp
2. WHEN [any API response is returned] THEN [the system] SHALL log the response status, headers, body, and processing time
3. WHEN [I want to filter logs] THEN [the system] SHALL allow filtering by status code ranges (400-499, 500-599)
4. WHEN [I want to analyze errors] THEN [the system] SHALL provide a command to display only failed requests with their correlation IDs
